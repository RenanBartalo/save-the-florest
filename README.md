# Save the Forest

## This is a game created as my first IronHack project as part of my Web Development Bootcamp course

## The game

### The game is a Tower Defense where you defend the forest with your super powerful birds, which release some laser shots from alien birds that want to conquer the forest

## How to play

### Just hover over the arena and select the square you want and click on this spot to place your bird

### Every time you kill an alien bird, you gain some resources to call more birds

### We have to score higher than 50 to win this game and if your enemy gets to the other side of the forest, he wins
