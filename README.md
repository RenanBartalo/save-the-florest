# Save the Forest

This is a game created as my first IronHack project as part of my Web Development Bootcamp course.

## The game

The game is a Tower Defense where you have super powerful birds, which release some laser shots to defend the flores from alien birds.

## How to play

* Just hover over the arena and select the square you want and click on this spot to place your bird. Your enemies come from the right.

* Every time you kill an alien bird, you gain more resources to call more birds.

* You have to **kill 50 aliens** to win this game and if your enemy gets to the other side of the forest, he wins.

## Prerequisites

This is a browser game.
